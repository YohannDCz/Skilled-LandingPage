## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I gain a larger knowledge in handling media queries. I discover other useful parameters like background-size, background-position which replace the famous object-fit and object-position respectively. I learned ti restet a value by overwritting media queries like top: auto for example.

### Continued development

I would like to experience more css by exploring responsive design with max/min margin and other parameter. I promise to applicate those in a next coding session on Frontend Mentor, particularly with an intermediate or expert landing page project.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) - This helped me for background sizing and positionning
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4396848/disable-or-reset-a-css-rule) - This is an amazing forum which helped me finally understand how to reset values.
